<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
    Hi there! I'm a computer science engineer, proud graduate from Government College Avasari. My journey in the tech world has been fueled by a passion for coding and problem-solving.

<p>
    As a Python developer and front-end enthusiast, I love building things that live on the internet. My goal is to create innovative and user-friendly solutions that make a positive impact.

    When I'm not coding, you can find me immersed in books, expressing my creativity through writing, or enjoying the rhythm of dance and music. I believe in the power of continuous learning and exploring new horizons.
